## Why it works
he content below may be useful to some, the Cydia repository is no longer available due to the maintaince overhead and my loss of interest. If you still want X11 on iOS/iPadOS, check out the <a href="https://github.com/ProcursusTeam/Procursus">Procursus project</a>.


I'm excited to announce that X11 is coming soon to iOS. Most (see below) packages and dependencies for a fully functioning X11 desktop system have been compiled and are available on Cydia for iOS 11+. All packages have been compiled for arm64 and have been tested on iOS 12.4 and iOS 13.1. This requires a jailbroken device.

This site will serve largely as documentation for building yourself. ~You can add the Cydia repo below for the deb packages. Please let me know if you run across any issues with the debs; it's likely I messed up including a library or something like that. (These aren't done just yet.)~
